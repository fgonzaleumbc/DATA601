    "This notebook provides an overview of creating custom functions in python and how to use them. The notebook also formally introduces the use of modules, libraries, and packages as well as how to explore and call functions within those modules. One of the advantages of Python is that further funtionality can be added by adding modules. As a program gets longer, Python allows to split scripts files and functions into a several files and modules. This permits easier maintenance by allowing to call functions and scripts from the separate modules without having to copy each script into each program. Further information can be found in the Python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#standard-modules\n",
