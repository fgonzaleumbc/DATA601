    "This notebook provides an overview of some basic concepts in Python Programming Language and Jupyter Notebooks. Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. Is relatively simple, it's easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on readability. Supports the use of modules and packages, programs can be designed in a modular style and code can be reused across a variety of projects. Other characteristics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open source/free: no need to worry about licences,\n",
    "- Cross-platform: Can be used with Windows/Macs OS/Linux – even Android and iOS!\n",
    "- Full-featured Packages: If there’s something you want to do, there’s probably a package out there to help you\n",
    "- Code Portability: With most code, it can run unaltered on a plethora of computers so long as all the required modules are supplied\n",
    "- Large and Growing Community: People from all fields from Data Science to Physics are coding in Python, creating a diverse and rich community of experts all over.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) is a graphical user interface that runs in a web browser and can run Python and other programming languages. Is a tool used in data science to perform and document data analyses. It helps in running code within cells, documenting results, sharing code and results, among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Documentation canb e found at https://docs.python.org. Python community also maintains a proposed enhanced proposal at https://peps.python.org/."

    "    - \"Markdown\" cell you can put text with explanations\n",
    "    - \"Code\" cell allows you to write Python code and run it.\n",
    "- To edit a Jupyter Notebook cell double click.\n",
    "- Be careful with quotes especially when handling Text and Strings. In Python dobule quotes \"\" or single quotes ' ' can be used in various functions. However, they need to be alternated when they are used within a function that requires them. More on this later. \n",
    "- <b><u>DOCUMENTATION</u></b> of a module/library/packages will be extremely important. During the class we will be using various Python libraries and accessing the documentation to learn about the included functions and parameters. The base Python documentation can be found at: https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Most Useful Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts\n",
    "- Shift+Tab: Access <b><u>documentation</u></b> of a function. \n",
    "- Ctrl+S: Saves the notebook.\n",
    "- Shift+enter: Runs a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Documentation:\n",
    "Documentation can be accessed in various ways that will be discussed in more detail during the class.\n",
    "- The documentation of a Module/Library/Package and their functions is published by the developer in their website. Note that <b><u>documentation</u></b> quality may vary from library to library.\n",
