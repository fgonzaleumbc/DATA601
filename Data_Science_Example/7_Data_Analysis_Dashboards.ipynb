    "\n",
    "Python has various libraries that allow for data dashboards. In this notebook, a dashboard is developed using [Jupyter Notebook Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html). Python has various other libraries used for developing dashboards. These include Anaconda Panel, Plotly Dash, Streamlit, Voila among others. Amazon Web Services, MS Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Microstrategy, Palantir Foundry, Tableau are other commercially available platforms that have their own platforms, frameworks and libraries that also allow for developing data analysis dashboard like applications.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook Widgets have one advantage in that they can be quickly developed in a Jupyter Notebook and allows a data scientist to develop a concept and explore potential capabilities of a dashboard while also allowing to identify early limitations of the data and the tools without spending the resources in developing a webbased dashboard. However, the main disadvantage of Jupyter Notebook Widgets is that they cannot be deployed in a Website framework or an application easily and will need to be moved to another platform if the stakeholder decides to proceed. The other libraries above all have different advanatages and limitations and would need to be evaluated separately depending on the needs of the stakeholders and the organization.\n",

    "# Notebook Goal\n",
    "This notebook leverages the output of the 1_Data_Cleaning_Template.ipynb Notebook and continues into the next step to further analyze the data to extract insights. This includes but is not limited to provide visualizations, plots, charts, statistics, correlations, relationship between features, patterns, trends, anomalies, test hypothesis for feature selection, identify potential features to use in clustering or classification and other AI/ML algorithms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal is to show what the EDA and visualizations would show and look for. There are hundreds of visualization types. What will drive which plots you create will be what are you trying to achieve. What story are you trying to make? What is the decision that you want to make? How can you convince your stakeholders? The data will also limit on what you will be able to do and show. The purpose of this notebook is to give you some ideas on plots that we can make and what general functions we can use. There may be other more advanced functions that can be used as well and it is important to review sample plots from visualization libraries like Matplotlib, SNS, Plotly, JSD3 and others. Their example gallery will potentially give you more ideas on things that you can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used as a template for quickly developing data analysis dashboards of any data as long as it has been cleaned using the 1_Data_Cleaning_Template.ipynb. Once the data is loaded as a dataframe (DF), most functions can be used as is with some modifications. Modifications include updating the options of the filtering (in section named \"Categorical Columns Menu Option Lists for Filtering\" and \"DF_DATA\" dictionary) and the filtering options in the \"Main Data Filtering Widget\" as well as the df_data_filtering and all variables as they relate to the filtering columns names and unique values in the \"Main Data Filtering Widget\" and the \"Data Filtering Widget\". Identifying the other functions that need to be modified is easier just running the widgets and fixing where the errors are at."

    "The text analysis and modeling algorithms perform several types of analyses. This include Latent Derechlit Allocation (LDA) which is a type of topic model as well as text clustering using Kmeans and DBSCAN algorithms. These algorithms provide insights by clustering reports into similar groups of reports and givin statistics on the top terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA: \n",
    "\n",
    "KMEANS: In the Kmeans algorithm the user specifies number of clusters. With this parameter the algorithm separates the records in the specified number of clusters. The number of clusters can also include an optimal number of clusters where the distance between two datapoints is optimal for the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN: The DBSCAN algorithm uses to main parameters EPS and minimum samples in a cluster. The EPS value is the required distance between two datapoints to be considered a cluster. The minimum samples in a cluster is the required number of datapoints to be considered a cluster. Note that low minimum sample in clusters (e.g., 2) can result in a large number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: Clustering algorithms (non-LDA algorithms) can breakdown with datasets with high dimensionality and may not provide meaningful clusters. Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA and TSNE) are used in combination with the clustering algorithms (i.e., Kmeans and DBSCAN) to project high dimensions to lower dimensions (e.g., 2D, 3D, etc.) to identify clusters. The scatter plots here are a 2D projections based on TSNE and PCA mathematical techniques. In the case of TSNE, it naturally expands dense clusters, and contracts sparse ones, evening out cluster sizes given the Perplexity parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: Based on experience, to identify meaningful cluster and high relationship to the terms it is better to use term score. For example, TFIDF scores above 0.10 are considered to have good relationship to the cluster. Lower values can also represent good relationship as long as several terms are related. To explore terms and topics it is recommended to run Kmeans with no Dimensionality Reduction and DBSCAN with both PCA and TSNE.\n",

    "There are two main methods for reducing the dimensionality of high dimensional data. These two are PCA and TSNE. When a dataset is high number of dimension and clustering will be performed it is typically recommended to use some form of dimensionality reduction. These methods find a mathematical representatation of multi-dimensionsional data (i.e., >3D) in three or two dimensions. In this case everyword within each record (e.g., movie title and overview) is a dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "For both methods (i.e., PCA and TSNE) an array of the reduced dimensions for performing the clustering calculation is created (bow_calc_array). This reduces the dimensionality to 2 dimensions and is a projection from the full bag of words array (bow_array). The bow_calc_array is then scaled as bow_calc_array_scaled and used in the clustering algorithm. The bow_array include all terms and words (i.e., features). In this functions, the bow_calc_array is always used for the calculation of the clusters while the bow_array is always used for the determination of top words within a cluster. \n",

    "These functions are used to create the plots in the cluster including the projections of the data in 2-Dimensions. The projections can be used to verify that the clustering algorithm is behaving correctly. For example, when Dimensionality Reduction is used the projection plot should have each data point near them with the same color of cluster unless it is in the edge of the cluster. When no dimensionality reduction is used the expected behavior is that the data points for each cluster be overimposed within one another. That is because the clustering algorithm did not used the reduced dimensionality data but rather all the dimensions and is an expected behavior.\n",
